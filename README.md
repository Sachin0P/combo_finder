# ðŸ§© ComboFinder

A Python-based solution to the **combo finder problem** by PSRANA â€” the goal is to find all valid combinations of products whose **total price** lies between **290 and 310**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

**Find all combinations of products** from a given list where the total sum of selected product prices falls within the range of **290 to 310** (inclusive).

### Product List Used:
    `
    ProductList = {'p1': 70, 'p2': 80, 'p3': 90, 'p4': 100, 'p5': 110, 'p6': 120, 'p7': 130}

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

    Python 3.x

    Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

    itertools for generating combinations

    Dictionary and list manipulations

ðŸš€ How to Run

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Sachin0P/combo_finder.git
    cd combo_finder

Open the notebook:

    jupyter notebook solution_combo_finder.ipynb

    Run the notebook cell-by-cell. It will display all valid product combinations whose total price is between 290 and 310.

ðŸ“ˆ Output

    The output lists all combinations of products (e.g., ['p2', 'p3', 'p4']) whose total value lies in the specified range.

    You can modify the price range or product list easily to reuse the logic for other cases.
